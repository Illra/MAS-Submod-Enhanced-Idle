# Enhanced Idle:
This submod allows Monika to occasionally look over at what you're doing (Works best for multi-monitor setups or a small MAS window on a single monitor). She may also be daydreaming about you.

NOTE: This does **not** work for Mac as it requires OS specific things and I have no feasible way of testing it. While MAS will not crash if this is installed on a Mac, it simply will not change the behaviour of Monika's idle poses.


### Changes:
#### Affectionate Idle:
- 70% chance for her to do her current affectionate idle poses
- 30% chance for her to look over at your mouse cursor

#### Enamoured Idle:
- 50% chance for her to do her current enamoured idle poses
- 50% chance for her to look over at your mouse cursor

#### Love Idle:
- 30% chance for her to do her current love idle poses
- 70% chance for her to look over at your mouse cursor


This is mainly a minor, but adorable change to the idle sprites to let Moni be a little more *aware* of things happening outside MAS

NOTE: For Linux, this REQUIRES `xdotool` to be installed (much like windowreacts do)

This is compatible with the [Submod Updater Plugin](https://github.com/Booplicate/MAS-Submods-SubmodUpdaterPlugin/releases/latest)! Install that to update with ease
